# To Do

> A list of To Dos for the project

### High Priority

* Test (audio, locations)
* Keep audio (or fade out) when found location
* Go to the first one welcome screen on 'More Info' select
* Help for people to find where they're going
  * Opening ‘select a bandstand’ after welcome screens should open up the map, rather than the list of bandstands.
  * Or we could have an icon on the opening screen to a location with the distances, getting closer etc - that opens up the location map screen.
  * Bandstand Screen navigation, Waypoint/compass

### Medium Priority

* Add self location to map
* Find (calculate) next Bandstand

* Lighten/less fade background images behind the location front screens.
* Darken performance screens background images, no 2 3 4.
* Menu popup on first
* Events on a map

### Low Priority

* Review/Tidy code
* Music comes in too early, change distance?
* Dancing Video
* Hide menu on bandstand until last page
* Map redesign
